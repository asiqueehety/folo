# FoLo - A lost & found platform

Losing stuff is an everyday thing for almost all of us. Some of us lose and forget it even ever existed until that one saturday morning while brushing teeth we remember in nostalgia. Well, a lucky fact, the vice versa also happens. People keep finding stuff a lot too. It could just be possible that somebody somewhere found something exactly what you've been looking for for months, but how'd you know who-where-when found it?

You'll never know, until you stumble upon FoLo. A platform for you to find what you lost, and also a platform to return what you found!
